# AI-Powered Applications with RAG and LangChain Agents  

This repository contains two AI-driven projects:  

## Task 1: Multiple Document RAG QA on Streamlit  
- Implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) QA system** using **ChromaDB** and **Google Gemini**.  
- Allows users to query multiple documents and receive AI-generated responses.  

## Task 3: LangChain-Based AI Agent for Code Generation & Execution  
- A **LangChain agent** that can **generate and execute Python code**.  
- Uses **Google Gemini** for natural language processing and integrates a secure Python execution tool.

# Task 1: Multiple Document RAG QA on Streamlit  
###**Demo Link:**
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EzJkbnfOYPNdLbCLTV04LrhyMc4wqQry/view?usp=sharing
### **Overview**  
This project enables users to **ask questions across multiple documents** and receive AI-powered responses using a RAG-based pipeline.  

### **Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend**: Streamlit  
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB  
- **Embeddings**: Sentence-Transformers  
- **LLM**: Google Gemini  

### **Features**  
✅ Upload multiple documents (.pdf, .txt, .docx, etc.)  
✅ Convert documents into vector embeddings  
✅ Query documents and retrieve relevant content  
✅ Generate AI responses using Gemini  

### **Setup Instructions**  
#### 1️⃣ Install dependencies  
```bash
pip install streamlit chromadb sentence-transformers google-generativeai
```
#### Note: for this code to work, You need to add your own personal Gemini Api Key in a .env file in the format Gemini_Api_Key="api key"
#### 2️⃣ Run the Streamlit app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
# Task 3: LangChain-Based AI Agent for Code Generation & Execution

Note: to keep the video simple to understand and easy to verify, simple codes have been generated by the agent. It can though generate code that is much more complex. Although the scope presently is limited to python  

## Overview
This LangChain-powered agent can generate Python code from natural language prompts and execute it securely.

## Tech Stack
- **LLM**: Google Gemini  
- **LangChain**: For agent orchestration  
- **Python Execution Tool**: Custom secure execution environment  

## Features
✅ Generates Python code from text prompts  
✅ Securely executes Python code in an isolated environment  
✅ Returns output/errors from execution  

## Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies  
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-google-genai google-generativeai
```

### 2️⃣ Run the agent  
```python
pyton app.py
```
